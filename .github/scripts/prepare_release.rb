# Prepares a release, driven by .github/workflows/release.yml:
#
#   1. bumps VERSION by patch / minor / major
#   2. turns the CHANGELOG's "Unreleased" section into a dated one for the new
#      version
#   3. writes the GitHub Release body — that section plus a compare link — to the
#      path given as the second argument
#
# Prints `key=value` lines for GITHUB_OUTPUT. Touches no git state — the
# workflow commits, tags and pushes, so a failed image build leaves nothing
# behind.
